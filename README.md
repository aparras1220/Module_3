# Module_3 Challenge: Election Analysis Homework

##Overview of Election-Audit

  The reason for the election audit is to review both the county and canidate votes for accuracy. It allows us to review the total number of votes per canidate and county as well as calucate for us the winner of the elecation. Being able to print it for us in an easily readable format allows for the CO board of electors to easily review the results of the dataset.

##Election-Audit Summary

  This script for reviewing the data is very universal. With a few minor modification, this code can be used with any election. One example of the code listed below is the script where we pull the information from the colums of the dataset to count the new of votes, whether it be for canidate or county. If need be we can adjust the colum number (highlighted) to whatever value we are using for the dataset.

  We could also use this code for presidential elections. Even with such a large amount of data, we could alter the code to be by state for the canidates and be able to validate the winner as well as the differnce in votes and percentages.
